% This file guides the user through analyses of a dataset acquired with the
% goal of spatial reconstruction of visual stimuli using an inverted
% encoding model (IEM) (see Sprague, Saproo & Serences, 2015, TICS).
% Participants viewed peripheral flickering checkerboard stimuli presented
% at a range of contrasts (0-70%, logarithmically spaced) while performing
% either a demanding target detection task (contrast change) at the
% stimulus position ("attend stimulus" condition) or at the fixation point
% ("attend fixation" condition). The stimuli appeared randomly on the left
% or right side of the screen. Targets appeared rarely, and trials in which
% targets do appear are not included in analyses. Thus, sensory
% conditions are perfectly equated across the attend stimulus and the
% attend fixation conditions.
%
% In addition to this main attention task, paricipants also performed a
% "spatial mapping" task in which they viewed small checkerboard discs
% presented at different positions on the screen while they performed a
% demanding fixation task (contrast change detection). If you have any
% questions about the tasks, please ask the instructor.

%% load the data
load([root 'fMRI_spatial/AL61_Bilat-V1_attnContrast.mat']);
% you'll find several variables:
% - tst: the task data - each row is a trial, each column a voxel
% - trn: the encoding model estimation data - each row is a trial, each
%   column is a voxel. the number of columns should be the same in trn & tst
% - trn_r: run number for encoding model estimation data
% - tst_r: run number for task data
% - trn_conds: condition labels for each trial of the encoding model
%   estimation data, where columns indicate:
%    - 1: x position of center of training stimulus in DVA
%    - 2: y position of center of training stimulus in DVA (SCREEN COORDS!)
% - tst_conds: condition labels for each trial of the task data, where columns indicate:
%    - 1: whether the stimulus appeared on the left or right of the screen
%         (1 or 2)
%    - 2: contrast level (1-6, 1 being the lowest, 6 being the highest)
%    - 3: task condition (attend fixation, 1, or attend stimulus, 2)
%    - 4: target present? (0: no, 1: yes)

%% train encoding model
% this is broken up into several subtasks - the first of which is
% generating a stimulus mask. Because the stimulus is a circle w/ a known,
% jittered location on each trial, we can just generate a binary image of
% 0's and 1's, with 1's at the positions subtended by the stimulus and 0's
% elsewhere. A similar technique is used by those mapping population
% receptive fields (pRFs).(Dumoulin & Wandell, 2008; Kay et al, 2013)
%
% This trial-by-trial stimulus mask will then be projected onto each
% channel's filter (a 2-d Gaussian-like function, usually). This amounts to
% a reduction in dimensionality from n_pixels to n_channels, though the
% transformation is necessarily lossy in this framework
%
% Use the trn_conds coordinates (first column is x, second column is y),
% and the stimulus size of 1.449 dva to generate a stimulus mask of 1's and
% 0's. The visual field area subtended by the display was 16.128 dva
% horizontally and 9.072 dva vertically (full width/height edge-to-edge).
%
% At this stage, it doesn't matter if we overestimate the size of the
% screen, so for simplicity let's say the screen is 10 dva tall and 17 dva
% wide.


trn_conds(:,2) = trn_conds(:,2)*-1; % flip to cartesian coordinates to make life easier
stim_size = 1.449; % radius

% we also need to decide on a resolution at which to compute stimulus masks
% and spatial filters (below) - let's do 171 (horiz) x 101 (vert)

res = [171 101];

[xx, yy] = meshgrid(linspace(-17/2,17/2,res(1)),linspace(-10/2,10/2,res(2)));
xx = reshape(xx,numel(xx),1);yy = reshape(yy,numel(yy),1);

stim_mask = zeros(length(xx),size(trn_conds,1));

for ii = 1:size(trn_conds,1)
    rr = sqrt((xx-trn_conds(ii,1)).^2+(yy-trn_conds(ii,2)).^2);
    stim_mask(rr <= stim_size,ii) = 1; % assume constant stimulus size here
end
% check the stimulus masks by plotting a column of the stimulus mask as an
% image
tr_num = 5;
figure;
this_img = reshape(stim_mask(:,tr_num),res(2),res(1)); % x, y are transposed here because images are row (y), column (x)
imagesc(xx,yy,this_img);colormap gray; axis xy equal off;
title(sprintf('Trial %i (%0.02f, %0.02f)',tr_num,trn_conds(tr_num,1),trn_conds(tr_num,2)));

% Spot-check a few trials - does everything look ok? Also try plotting a
% figure showing the visual field coverage - the extent of the screen
% subtended by *any* stimulus, across all trials. In this particular
% experiment, we randomized the position of each and every trial (relative
% to a fixed grid). This means that there will not necessarily be perfectly
% even coverage of the entire screen, but it does increase the number of
% unique stimulus positions we can use for encoding model estimation.


%% build an encoding model
%
% an encoding model describes how a neural unit responds to an arbitrary
% set of stimluli. A common encoding model for visual stimuli measured for
% decades in the spatial receptive field (RF). Rather than directly
% estimate the exact receptive field of each voxel, we'll instead suppose
% that there are a discrete number of possible RF positions (that is, a
% discrete number of spatial filters) which describe discrete neural
% subpopulations. Each voxel then can be modeled as a weighted sum of these
% discrete subpopulations. While this is of course an approximation of the
% actual nature of RF properties in the visual system, by supposing a small
% number of possible RF positions/subpopulations we can *invert* the
% estimated encoding model (which is a set of weights on each supopulation
% for each voxel) in order to reconstruct the activation of each
% population given a novel voxel activation pattern observed (below). 
%
% First, let's generate the filters corresponding to our hypothetical
% neural populations. We'll assume, for simplicity, that they are a square
% grid and are all the same "size" (FWHM). If interested, try varying these
% parameters. 

% Let's set the center points:
rfPtsX = [-4:4] * stim_size;
rfPtsY = [-2:2] * stim_size;
[rfGridX,rfGridY] = meshgrid(rfPtsX,rfPtsY); 
rfGridX = reshape(rfGridX,numel(rfGridX),1);rfGridY = reshape(rfGridY,numel(rfGridY),1);
rfSize = 1.25*stim_size;   % for the filter shape we use (see below), this size/spacing ratio works well (see Sprague & Serences, 2013)

% because we're projecting a stimulus mask onto a lower-dimensional set of
% filters, we call the set of filters (or information channels) our basis
% set

basis_set = nan(size(xx,1),size(rfGridX,1)); % initialize

for bb = 1:size(basis_set,2)
    
    % the form of the basis function I use is a gaussian-like blob which
    % reaches zero at a known distance from its center, which is 2.5166x
    % the FWHM of the function. We'll define the FWHM as rfSize (above),
    % which means the "size" parameter of our function is 2.5166*rfSize.
    %
    % I've made a function (make2dcos) which we can use for generating each
    % individual basis function
    
    basis_set(:,bb) = make2dcos(xx,yy,rfGridX(bb),rfGridY(bb),rfSize*2.5166,7);
end

% let's look at the basis set
% I've created a function "plot_basis_rect" which takes a matrix of the
% basis set, number of X & Y points spanned by the basis set, and the x/y
% resolution of each filter. The function plots all basis functions
% (filters), as well as a surface plot showing the sum of all filters

plot_basis_rect(basis_set',length(rfPtsX),length(rfPtsY),res(1),res(2));

% You can see that we've created a set of spatial RFs which span the space
% subtended by our mapping stimulus. Additionally, the second figure shows
% the "coverage" of the basis set, as well as the "smoothness" of its
% coverage over space. In our experience, this
% approxmimate ratio of FWHM:spacing for a square grid works well. A
% hexagonal grid of basis functions also works well, and in that case
% because the mean distance between each basis function is slightly
% smaller, the best FWHM:spacing ratio is also slightly smaller.
% 
% Above, you can try changing the size of each basis function by changing
% the "1" before "rfSize" in the call to make2dcos - try bigger and smaller
% basis function sizes. What are the advantages and disadvantages to each?
% Come back to this once you've reached the end of the tutorial and try
% processing the data w/ several basis function sizes. 

%% compute predicted channel responses
%
% Now that we have a stimulus mask and a set of spatial filters/information
% channels, we want to determine the contribution of each information
% channel (hypothetical neural population) to each voxel. We set up the
% problem like a standard general linear model often used for fMRI
% activation map-based analyses:
% y = beta*X, where:
% - y is the measured signal in a voxel across all trials (1 x n_trials)
% - beta is the weights corresponding to how much each channel's response
%   contributes to each voxel (stable across trials, 1 x n_channels)
% - X is a design matrix, which is how much each hypothetical population,
%   with its defined RF, should respond to the stimulus (which we know)
%   (n_trials x n_channels)
%
% note that X is the same design matrix used for any standard GLM-based
% analysis in fMRI - we're just defining our "predictors" a bit
% differently. Here, predictors are predicted channel responses to known
% stimuli on each trial (the stimulus mask above). 
%
% In order to compute the design matrix, we simply compute the overlap of
% the stimulus mask onto each channel. 

trnX = stim_mask.' * basis_set;
trnX = trnX./max(trnX(:));        % and normalize to 1


% now let's double-check our filtering by plotting the predicted channel
% responses for a given trial next to the stimulus mask for that trial
tr_num = 5;
figure;
subplot(1,2,1);
imagesc(xx,yy,reshape(stim_mask(:,tr_num), res(2),res(1)));
axis xy equal off;
title(sprintf('Trial %i: stimulus',tr_num));

subplot(1,2,2);
imagesc(rfPtsX,rfPtsY,reshape(trnX(tr_num,:),length(rfPtsY),length(rfPtsX)));
axis xy equal off;
title(sprintf('Predicted channel responses'));
colormap gray;

%% estimate channel weights using training data
% 
% Now that we have our design matrix and our measured signal, we need to
% solve for the weights ("betas" in above equation). Because we have more
% trials than channels, and because our stimulus positions are unique on
% each trial, we should be able to estimate a unique solution for the
% channel weights given our observed activation pattern using ordinary
% least squares regression. 

% first, let's be sure our design matrix is "full-rank" (that is, that no
% predicted channel responses are colinear). This is always important to
% check, and could come about if you're using channels that are not
% uniquely sampled by the stimulus set. For example, if above you multiply
% the rfPtsX, rfPtsY vectors each by 3 before generating the design matrix,
% you would notice that many of the channels (those correspondign to the
% edges of the display) will always have "0" predicted activity. This means
% that it is impossible to estimate the contribution of such a channel to
% the activation of a voxel. This is also why we can only model the
% stimulated portion of the screen along model dimensions which we control.
% As an example, V1 also has many orientation-selective populations (see
% IEM_ori_fMRI.m), but we did not systematically vary the stimulus orientation
% here, and so we cannot uniquely estimate the contribution of different
% oreintation-selective populations to the observed voxel activations in
% this dataset.
%
% As a thought exercise, what are other scenarios (stimulus conditions or
% hypothesized channel properties like size/position) which could result in
% design matrices w/out full rank?

fprintf('Rank of design matrix: %i\n',rank(trnX));

% So we've established that the design matrix is full-rank (the rank is
% equal to the number of columns). Let's estimate the channel weights.

% this is just pinv(trnX) * trn; - but I wrote out the full math for
% completness
w = inv(trnX.'*trnX)*trnX.' * trn; 

% (the above can also be written as: w = trnX\trn; )

% w is now n_channels x n_voxels. This step is massively univariate, and is
% identical to the step of estimating the beta weight corresponding to each
% predictor for each voxel in a standard fMRI GLM analysis. It's written
% above as a single matrix operation for brevity, but identical results are
% obtained when looping through individual voxels. 
%



%% Invert the encoding model and compute channel responses
%
% Our estimated "w" above reflects an ENCODING MODEL for each voxel. For a
% given region (here,  V1), we have an encoding model estimated for
% all voxels. Given our linear framework described above, we can INVERT the
% encoding model in order to estimate the channel activation pattern (like
% our trnX) which is associated with any novel activation pattern that is
% observed. The associated mapping from VOXEL SPACE into CHANNEL SPACE is
% computed from the pseudoinverse of the estimated weight matrix.
%
% This inversion step is where we get "inverted" encoding model from -
% we're not just estimating encoding models for single voxels and comparing
% them; we're instead estimating all encoding models, and using the joint
% set of encoding models to constrain a mapping from voxel space into
% channel space. 
%
% Once we have the inverted mapping (the pseudoinverse), we can map the
% novel activation pattern ("tst") back into channel space.

chan_resp = (inv(w*w')*w*tst').';  
% or can write as chan_resp = (w.'\tst.').'

% "chan_resp" is now the estimated channel responses for a novel dataset
% which was never used to estimate any encoding properties (that is, "tst"
% was never used in the computation of "w"). Each column of chan_resp
% corresponds to a channel, or hypothetical neural population response, and
% each row corresponds to a trial.


% Let's see what the channel responses look like across different trial
% types. For now, let's just look at high-contrast stimuli presented on the
% right side of the screen on attend-stimulus trials. 
%
% This means we'll search for trials with the following values in each of
% tst_conds' columns:
% column 1 (stimulus side, L or R):  1
% column 2 (stimulus contrast, 1-6): 6
% column 3 (task condition, attend fix or attend stim): 2
% column 4 (target present?): 0 (so that mean contrast is the same)
% 

thisidx = tst_conds(:,1)==1 & tst_conds(:,2)==6 & tst_conds(:,3)==2 & tst_conds(:,4)==0;
avg_chan_resp = mean(chan_resp(thisidx,:),1);
figure;ax(1)=subplot(1,2,1);
imagesc(rfPtsX,rfPtsY,reshape(avg_chan_resp,length(rfPtsY),length(rfPtsX)));
title('Left, high-contrast, attended stimuli');
axis equal xy off;colormap jet;

% now compare to trials when the stimulus was on the right

clear thisidx avg_chan_resp;
thisidx = tst_conds(:,1)==2 & tst_conds(:,2)==6 & tst_conds(:,3)==2 & tst_conds(:,4)==0;
avg_chan_resp = mean(chan_resp(thisidx,:),1);
ax(2)=subplot(1,2,2);
imagesc(rfPtsX,rfPtsY,reshape(avg_chan_resp,length(rfPtsY),length(rfPtsX)));
title('Right, high-contrast, attended stimuli');
axis equal xy off;colormap jet;

% importantly, we want to be sure all the axes are on the same color-scale.
% I wrote a function you can use for that called "match_clim", which takes
% a set of axis handles as inputs, and optionally a new set of clim values
% as a second argument. 

match_clim(ax);

% It should be clear that the channels with RFs near the attended stimulus
% position are those which are most active when that sitmulus is present &
% attended.


% Let's check out all the conditions - the easiest way to do this is have
% one figure for stimuli on the left, and another figure for stimuli on the
% right.

%% Compute stimulus reconstructions from channel responses
%
% The channel response plots above are the *full* dataset, though sometimes
% it is useful to compute a stimulus reconstruction that can be mroe easily
% quanitfied by, e.g., curvefitting methods. Furthermore, the discrete
% values above are challenging to "coregister" across different stimulus
% position conditions (at least when stimuli are not simply at the same
% position on different sides of the screen). Take for example a scenario
% like Sprague, Ester & Serences, 2014 - during a spatial WM task, a
% remembered stimulus appeared at a random position along a ring of a given
% eccentricity. Because we were not interested in whether or not
% representations for stimuli at different positions were different from
% one another, we sought to average representations for stimuli at
% different positions together. We did this by reconstructing an "image" of
% the contents of WM via a weighted sum of the spatial filters for each
% channel. Let's try that here.
%
% We have our basis_set, used to compute predicted channel responses, and
% we have our estimated channel responses (chan_resp) - to compute the
% weighted sum as an image, we just need to multiply the two.

stim_reconstructions = chan_resp * basis_set.';

% Importantly, the dimensionality of each reconstruction remains equal to
% the number of channels used, but this enables easy averaging of stimuli
% at different positions (say, around a circular ring) by changing the
% basis set in order to "undo" the stimulus manipulation performed. See
% Sprague, Ester & Serences, 2014, for more details (Fig 2E). We won't go
% over that here. This discussion is mainly to illustrate that we gain no
% information in going from channel responses to stimulus reconstructions,
% but the added ability to coregister and average different stimuli affords
% better sensitivity to low-amplitude/low-SNR representations in stimulus
% reconstructions. 

% We can now do all the analyses we performed above on channel response
% amplitudes instead on stimulus reconstructions. For example:

clear ax;
% trials when stimulus was on the left
thisidx = tst_conds(:,1)==1 & tst_conds(:,2)==6 & tst_conds(:,3)==2 & tst_conds(:,4)==0;
avg_reconstruction = mean(stim_reconstructions(thisidx,:),1);
figure;ax(1)=subplot(1,2,1);
imagesc(xx,yy,reshape(avg_reconstruction,res(2),res(1)));
title('Left, high-contrast, attended stimuli');
axis equal xy off;colormap jet;

% now compare to trials when the stimulus was on the right

clear thisidx avg_chan_resp;
thisidx = tst_conds(:,1)==2 & tst_conds(:,2)==6 & tst_conds(:,3)==2 & tst_conds(:,4)==0;
avg_reconstruction = mean(stim_reconstructions(thisidx,:),1);
ax(2)=subplot(1,2,2);
imagesc(xx,yy,reshape(avg_reconstruction,res(2),res(1)));
title('Right, high-contrast, attended stimuli');
axis equal xy off;colormap jet;

match_clim(ax);


%% combine non-like stimulus feature values
%
% One of the biggest advantages of the IEM technique is that by
% transforming activation patterns into a "feature space" (here, spatial
% information channels), you have full knowledge of how your activation is
% related to feature values. Put another way, you know how to manipulate
% your feature space in order to coregister non-like trials. For example,
% here, we don't necessarily care too much about what may or may not be
% different in stimulus reconstructions computed from trials in which
% stimuli were on the left compared with trials when stimuli were on the
% right. Accordingly, we can average these trials after "coregistering" the
% reconstructions. Fortunately, this is an easy dataset to coregister. We
% just need to flip the reconstructions across the vertical meridan for one
% half of trials (sorted by trn_conds(:,1), which is the stimulus side). It
% doesn't matter whether we flip left trials onto the right side of the
% screen or vice versa. Try it below!

% so that it's easy to "flip" the reconstructions, let's turn our
% reconstruciton matrix, in which each reconstruction occupies a row (n_trials x n_pixels), 
% into a reconstruction 3d-matrix in which each trial is the 3rd dimension,
% and each "slice" is a single-trial's stimulus reconstruction. It's
% easiest to make trial the 3rd dimension so that we don't need to
% "squeeze" the data later on.

stim_reconstructions_mat = reshape(stim_reconstructions',res(2),res(1),size(stim_reconstructions,1));

% now, look for all trials with tst_cond(:,1)==1 and "coregister" them by 
% flipping the slice of the matrix across the vertical axis (hint: FLIPLR)

stim_reconstructions_mat(:,:,tst_conds(:,1)==1) = fliplr(stim_reconstructions_mat(:,:,tst_conds(:,1)==1));



% now we can plot a similar figure as above, but with all trials on the
% same plot.

figure;ax = [];

    for stim_contrast = 1:6
        ax(end+1) = subplot(6,2,attn_cond+(stim_contrast-1)*2);
